I'm a postdoc researcher at the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS), Rutgers University, hosted by <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/people/professors/details/david-pennock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Pennock</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~lirong.xia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lirong Xia</a>.
My research designs theoretically robust evaluation metrics to incentivize high-effort human feedback, evaluate data quality, and supervise AI.

<h2>My Research</h2>
<p>
  My earlier research centers on <strong>peer prediction</strong>, where the goal is to design scoring and reward mechanisms that elicit honest, high-effort information without ground truth. 
  I develop evaluation metrics with provable guarantees that are efficient, adversary-robust, and interpretable, with an eye toward practical deployment for data quality and truth discovery.
</p>
<p>
  A relevant application is <strong>peer review</strong>. I study policies that combine reviewer signals with authors’ own information to improve acceptance decisions while reducing review workload. 
  I'm one of the main organizers of the annual <a href="https://ec4academia.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workshop on Incentives in Academia (WINA)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  More recently, I examine how <strong>generative AI</strong> reshapes data collection. 
  My work investigates how to detect and discourage LLM-generated or low-effort feedback, and how to safely use noisy or misaligned AI feedback in downstream decision-making.
